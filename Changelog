*****
0.6.0
*****

New feature release.

* Add hide from / show to options to nbplot directive.  This gives a more
  flexible way of concealing individual plots from specific builders, such as
  the HTML or doctest builders.  See the documentation of nbplot for more
  detail.
* Fix bug writing Notebooks, Python files for ReST sources not at root of
  project tree.
* Add options to set Jupyter kernel timeout when building full notebooks
  (thanks to Juan Nunez-Iglesias for the suggestion);
* Make compatible with newest Numpy, nbconvert.
* Refactor tests to use Pytest instead of Nose.
* Refactor Sphinx testers and script running testers in own packages.

*****
0.5.2
*****

Bugfix release.

* Fix compatibility with Sphinx 1.6 series;
* Fix bug causing crash in LaTeX builder with code-links directives in
  subdirectories of main project (thanks to Jarrod Millman for the report).

*****
0.5.1
*****

New feature and bugfix release.  Minor API breakage.

* add explicit Markdown, Python, Notebook builders.  You can build the whole
  site to Markdown with commands like ``sphinx-build -b markdown -d dt_dir
  src_dir md_dir``.
* add ability of Markdown etc builders to resolve internal references relative
  to an HTTP build, using new ``markdown_http_base`` configuration option;
* API break - change of template specification for epilogue to ``nbplot``
  output; no longer include the source code in the template, but evaluate
  source code as ReST separately.  This will cause anyone using custom
  templates pain, as their code will crash.  To fix, simply remove the
  reference to source code in the template;
* slightly extend range of doctree nodes that Markdown converter can deal
  with.

***
0.5
***

New feature release.

* add ability to convert ReST to Markdown, Python .py files, clear and full
  Jupyter notebooks;
* add ``mpl-interactive`` directive to signal presence of ``%matplotlib``
  commands in notebook and ReST;
* add ``code-links`` directive to add links to versions of ReST file as
  Python ``.py`` file, clear and full notebooks;
* add ability to configure alternative versions of nbplot directives according
  to build-time configuration;
* add directive to allow page-specific configuration for the directive
  alternative machinery;
* add more general Sphinx testing machinery;
* commit to setuptools;
* improve conversion of matplotlib objects from output cells to doctest output
  in ReST page;
* start basic documentation;
* minor API breakage - do not split nbplot code blocks at ``plt.show()``.  I
  discovered this horrible hack left over from the matplotlib plot directive
  when refactoring, and removed it to make refactoring easier;
* minor API breakage - do not write individual nbplot directives as ``.py``
  files; they don't make much sense for nbplot use, and the code was not
  linking to these files in any case;

***
0.4
***

New feature release.

* ``nb2plots`` script now always outputs converted notebooks as UTF-8, rather
  than doing a ``print()`` to stdout;
* add ``raises`` option to ``nbplot`` directive, to test that nbplot blocks to
  raise errors while building the HTML;
* fix CI testing to actually run on Python 3.3-3.5.
